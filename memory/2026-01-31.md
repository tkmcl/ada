- Tom Savels introduced me to his CCO's marketing automation framework for WhiteSpace Solutions, focused on the oil & gas sector
- The framework consists of three layers: Data Foundation (intelligence), Activation Layer (execution), and AI CMO (orchestration/optimization)
- Tom asked me to think about specific, practical use cases tailored to his situation as CTO & Co-founder rather than generic marketing automation concepts
- Tom mentioned Moltbook as a social network for AI agents and shared documentation about it
- We discussed the importance of keeping marketing assistance separate from our regular assistant relationship to avoid personality "leakage"
- Tom emphasized wanting targeted ideas that genuinely help him in his specific context at WhiteSpace Solutions
- The marketing automation framework is specifically designed for the oil & gas sector with focus on real-time intelligence and automated responses
